CALL FOR PAPERS
========================================================
2nd Workshop on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning

ICML 2015
July 11, Lille, France
http://fatml.org/
Submission Deadline: May 1, 2015

========================================================

OVERVIEW
----------------

Machine learning is increasingly part of our everyday lives, influencing not
only our individual interactions with online websites and platforms, but even
national policy decisions that shape society at large. When algorithms make
automated decisions that can affect our lives so profoundly, how do we make
sure that their decisions are fair, verifiable, and accountable? This workshop
will explore how to integrate these concerns into machine learning and how to
address them with computationally rigorous methods.

The workshop takes place at an important moment. The debate about ‘big data' on
both sides of the Atlantic has begun to expand beyond issues of privacy and
data protection. Policymakers, regulators, and advocates have recently
expressed fears about the potentially discriminatory impact of analytics, with
many calling for further technical research into the dangers of inadvertently
encoding bias into automated decisions.  At the same time, there is growing
alarm that the complexity of machine learning may reduce the justification for
consequential decisions to “the algorithm made me do it”.  Decision procedures
perceived as fundamentally inscrutable have drawn special scrutiny.

The workshop will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to
address these challenges head-on.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
--------------------------------

We welcome contributions on theoretical models, empirical work, and everything
in between, including (but not limited to) contributions that address the
following open questions:

* How can we achieve high classification accuracy while preventing
* discriminatory biases?

* What are meaningful formal fairness properties?

* What is the best way to represent how a classifier or model has generated a
* particular result?

* Can we certify that some output has an explanatory representation?

* How do we balance the need for knowledge of sensitive attributes for  fair
* modeling and classification with concerns and limitations around the
* collection and use of sensitive attributes?

* What ethical obligations does the machine learning community have when models
* affect the lives of real people?


PAPER SUBMISSION
------------------------------

Papers are limited to four content pages, including figures and tables, and
must follow the ICML 2015 format; however, an additional fifth page containing
only cited references is permitted. Papers SHOULD be anonymized. Accepted
papers will be made available on the workshop website; however, the workshop's
proceedings can be considered non-archival, meaning contributors are free to
publish their work in archival journals or conferences. Accepted papers will be
either presented as a talk or poster (to be determined by the workshop
organizers). 

Papers should be submitted here:

Deadline for submissions: May 1, 2015
Notification of acceptance: May 10, 2015
