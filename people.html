          <h2>Solon Barocas</h2>
          <p class="collapse" id="solon">Solon Barocas is a Postdoctoral
Research Associate at the Center for Information Technology Policy at
Princeton University. He is also a member of the National Science
Foundation-funded Council for Big Data, Ethics, and Society, an Affiliate of
the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, and a Visiting Research Fellow at the
Information Law Institute at New York University, where he completed his
doctorate in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communication. His research
focuses on emerging applications of machine learning and the ethical and
epistemological issues that they raise. His most recent work explains how data
mining discriminates, explores broader issues of fairness in algorithmic
decision-making, and considers the privacy implications of computer-automated
inference.<br /></p>

          <h2>Sorelle Friedler</h2>
<p class="collapse" id="sorelle">Sorelle Friedler is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Haverford
College. Her research interests include the design and analysis of algorithms,
computational geometry, data mining and machine learning, and the application
of such algorithms to interdisciplinary data. Such applications have varied
from experimental chemistry data to indoor location determination to, more
recently, the examination of disparate impact in a computational context.
Before Haverford, Sorelle was a software engineer at Google, where she worked
in the Google X lab and in search infrastructure. She received a Ph.D. and
M.S. in computer science from the University of Maryland, College Park and a
B.A. in computer science from Swarthmore College.<br /></p>

<p class="collapse" id="hanna">Hanna Wallach is a researcher at Microsoft Research New York City and
an assistant professor in the School of Computer Science at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst. She is a core faculty member in
UMass's recently formed Computational Social Science Institute. Hanna
holds a BA in computer science from the University of Cambridge, an MS
in cognitive science from the University of Edinburgh, and a PhD in
machine learning from the University of Cambridge. Hanna develops
machine learning methods for uncovering new insights about the
structure, content, and dynamics of social processes. In collaboration
with political scientists, sociologists, and journalists, she analyzes
publicly available interaction data, such as public record email
networks, declassified document dumps, press releases, meeting
transcripts, and news articles. Hanna's research contributes to
machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and the interdisciplinary field
of computational social science. Her work on infinite belief networks
won the best paper award at AISTATS in 2010. Hanna is committed to
increasing diversity and has founded several organizations to address
the under-representation of women in computing, including the Women in
Machine Learning Workshop, now in its ninth year. Lastly, she is the
only person to have appeared in both Glamour magazine ("35 Women Under
35 Who Are Changing the Tech Industry") and Linux Format.
